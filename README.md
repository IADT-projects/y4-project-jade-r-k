# Comparative Analysis of Static and Interactive Form Design
## 4th year Major Project by Jade Kelly
The aim of this project was to conduct a comparative study on user experience and engagement on static and interactive form design. The web application for this study was developed using ReactJS, a JavaScript library and React Bootstrap, a JavaScript framework built for React. The purpose of this study is to examine if interactive design improves user experience and time to complete a form. The steps involved in the development of the application were finding an existing form to use for the layout, creating static and interactive versions of the design and hosting the finished application. Functional testing was carried out throughout and after implementation. The results from the study show no statistical difference was detected in the time taken to complete each form design. Nevertheless, the interactive design was preferred overall by users.
